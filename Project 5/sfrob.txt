comparison of commands sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs, sfrobu -f and sfrobs -f.

first I created a big file called bigFile, using the command
dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigFile.txt bs=1M count=5

here are the following time outputs:

time ./sfrob < bigFile.txt > output.txt

real    0m0.005s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.003s

time ./sfrobu < bigFile.txt > output.txt

real    0m0.145s
user    0m0.062s
sys     0m0.037s

time ./sfrobs < bigFile.txt > output.txt

real    0m0.091s
user    0m0.026s
sys     0m0.028s

time ./sfrobu -f < bigFile.txt > output.txt

real    0m0.149s
user    0m0.063s
sys     0m0.041s

time ./sfrobs -f < bigFile.txt > output.txt

real    0m0.083s
user    0m0.024s
sys     0m0.028s

Overall, as we can see from the above results of time, sfrob has
the best overall performance with a real time of 0.005s, which is
becuase sfrob makes fewer system calls, which are both buffered and
optimized.
Unsurprisingly, both sfrobu and sfrobu -f are slower than
sfrobs and sfrobs -f respectively, which was expected because
sfrob u and sfrobu -f perform many more syscalls than the shell
script sfrobs, which results in a large overhead and poor performance.
