First we checkout from v3.0 of Diffutils from my repository and create a
new branch with the same command using the -b option.
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then applied the patch from the lab to replace ` with ' with
patch -p0 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

git status confirmed that only 6 files are changed as a result of the
patch being applied. We then add these 6 files with

git add .
and then commit the changes in the file ChangeLog, which is a modified
version of git-log.txt
git commit -f ChangeLog

I then generate my patch by doing:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Which I then send to Sai Atmakuri, who will be my partner for the hw
portion.

I checkout of this branch into a branch called dcopy, in which I will
apply the Sai's patch and then make check it.

git checkout v3.0 -b dcopy

git am < ../formatted-patch-partner.txt

After seeing that the patch was applied, I then run
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
make distdir

I found that the ChangeLog file inside a new directory called
diffutils-3.0.1-4de5
has the first patch entry with author Sai Atmakuri,
indicating that the patch worked. 

Then to find the newest merge before/on the 1/25/2015, I first cd ~eggert
and then after going into cd src/gnu/emacs and then I type in the
command  gitk  which causes a window with a directory of merges to show up.
I type 1/25/2015 in the search to find a new merge on that day, which is in the
file gitk-screenshot.png
