Basically the pop-up window has a list of all the commits that have
been made in tree structure in the top third of the screen,
which has 3 subwindows: one for the name of the commit,
one for the author, and one for the date on which the commit was made.

Below this there is a textbox indicating the SHA1 ID: which a unique ID
for every commit. Beside that there is a count of rows that indicates
where you are on the list.
One thing I noticed was that although the commit dates went further back
as a scrolled down, the dates were not in script descending order, which
could make commits a little harder to find.

Once you select a commit, you can see the files that were
impacted by the commit below it, and then on the bottom left there
shows up the actual contents of the commit selected on the top in diff
format, and the right there is a section that displays any comments
that may have been appended to the commit.
Above this section, there is a text box and a drop down list that is
used for searching by name, author, etc and can make finding commits
easier.
