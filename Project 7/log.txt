Flashing the beagleone (Following the steps in the link posted on Piazza):

First I download the latest suitable image supported by BeagleBone Green
Wireless, which is "Debian 9.3 2018-03-05 4GB SD IoT".

Then, after installing 7-zip, I decompress the .img file, after which
I write the image to my microSD card using Image Writer for Windows.

After this, I insert my microSD card into my BeagleBone and then connect
the BeagleBone to a power supply. The BeagleBone then started flashing in a
a pattern -- the first and third LEDs alternated with the second and fourth,
which indicates that the booting was in progress. This stopped after about
40 minutes, signifying that the flashing was complete.

I then connect my BeagleBone to my computer and open start.htm, where I
confirm that my BeagleBone was connected and that the drivers are installed.

Setting up the beaglebone:
First I ssh into root, with password root. Then I connected to
the right wifi using connnmanctl.
updated the database using: sudo apt-get update
install xauth and xvfb using: sudo apt-get install xauth
and sudo apt-get install xvfb

I then enable X11 forwarding by going into the necessary files and
changing 'no' to 'yes' for a couple X11 forwarding options.
Next I install firefox using: sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

I make sure I had all the openssh files by checking:
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

As I have both the client and the server files, I am good to go now.

I do the lab portion of this assignment with 2 partners: Sai Atmakuri and
Tanish Ambulkar.

I first act as the client for Sai. I generate my public and private keys
first
ssh-keygen

which I then save in "authorized-keys" by pressing enter.

I then proceed to authenticate  my public key using
ssh-copy-id -i devam@10.97.85.111

I enter the password devam

I then try the command ssh-add so that I can add my private key and be
able to log into the host without a password. But this doesn't work, so I
realize I have to use ssh-agent

eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add

I then attempt to ssh into the server using devam@10.97.85.111,
and I am able to get into the directory without having to enter a password.

I try to run the command firefox, and I get errors regarding the existence
of a firefox backend.

After doing some research, I realize that I need to start a session with
X11 session forwarding, so then I re-ssh using

ssh -X devam@10.97.85.111

and then I am able to run commmands like xterm and firefox.
I then created a file called test.txt to make sure that I am able to
edit and write to the server.

touch test.txt


I then proceed to act as the server for sai.
I first create an account for him using:

sudo useradd -d /home/sai -m sai
sudo passwd sai

I set the password to sai for simplicity
I then go into /home/sai and then create a .ssh directory for him using:

sudo mkdir .ssh

After that, I make sure sai has access permissions and change the ownership
to user 'sai' so that he can log on and write.

sudo chown -R sai .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

I send him my IP address by doing
ifconfig

which is 10.97.85.87

He then follows what I did as the client and is successfully able to
add his private key and ssh into the server without having to enter
a password.

I then repeated the same steps with Tanish Ambulkar, acting as both
the server and the client.
